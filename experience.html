    <h3>Mechanical Engineer — SFU Bionics Design Team</h3>
    <p><em>Burnaby, BC | Sep 2024 – Present</em></p>
    <p>
      Assisted in designing a bionic arm attachment for amputees by collecting
      arm measurements and creating CAD models in SolidWorks, with emphasis on
      comfort, scalability, and preparation for 3D-printed prototypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaborated closely with the electrical sub-team to ensure hardware
      compatibility, communicated design updates across the team, and integrated
      feedback to refine functionality and user comfort.
    </p>

    <h3>Satellite Communication Member — SFU Satellite Design Team</h3>
    <p><em>Burnaby, BC | Sep 2023 – Apr 2024</em></p>
    <p>
      Prepared engineering documentation including block diagrams, interface
      descriptions, and testing specifications for subsystem design reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researched and analyzed satellite antenna systems (patch, dipole, helical)
      based on mission link budgets, frequency bands, deployment constraints,
      and CubeSat standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supported RF subsystem validation by helping define test setups,
      early test procedures, and simulating RF pathways to minimize signal loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaborated with power and structures teams to validate signal integrity,
      power draw, and structural mounting of communication modules.
