    <p><strong>Systems Engineering Student — Simon Fraser University</strong></p>

    <p>
      I’m a Systems Engineering student with hands-on experience in mechanical design,
      CAD, and testing through academic projects and engineering design teams.
      I’m especially interested in robotics, space rovers, and projects where I can
      tinker with electronics and hardware.

<!-- ===== WHY SPACE ===== -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Why Space?</h2>

  <p>
    My curiosity about space began in middle school when my teacher talked about the
    Cassini mission and shared updates on its discoveries. Learning about a spacecraft
    exploring another planet made space feel vast, unknown, and exciting.
  </p>

  <p>
    During high school, watching SpaceX’s Demo-2 launch during the pandemic completely
    captivated me. Seeing astronauts launch from Earth for the first time in nearly a
    decade showed me how far human innovation has come—and how much farther we can still go.
