      <h3>Office Chair Hinge Structural Analysis</h3>
      <p><em>SolidWorks · FEA · CAD System Design</em></p>
      <p>
        Designed a mechanical hinge component and developed a manufacturable CAD
        model in preparation for structural analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created detailed engineering drawings, participated in design reviews,
        and collaborated with team members to refine mechanical components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developed Gantt charts to plan manufacturing timelines, track deadlines,
        and align team progress with project requirements.

  <div class="project">
    <img src="images/tensile.jpg" alt="Tensile Testing">
    <div>
      <h3>Mechanical Tensile Testing & Materials Lab</h3>
      <p><em>Data Analysis · Excel · Materials Testing</em></p>
      <p>
        Conducted tensile testing on metals and plastics using the PASCO ME-8230
        Materials Testing Machine to evaluate elastic and plastic behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analyzed force-displacement and stress-strain data using PASCO Capstone
        software and Excel, reporting Young’s modulus, yield stress, ultimate
        tensile stress, and material toughness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identified and troubleshot testing issues such as sample slippage,
        twisting, and measurement error to ensure accurate results.

    <div>
      <h3>Scooter Structural Design & Analysis</h3>
      <p><em>SolidWorks · FEA · Materials Selection</em></p>
      <p>
        Designed scooter components and wheel assemblies in SolidWorks while
        considering manufacturability and CAD/CAM workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintained detailed engineering documentation and BOMs for lab reporting
        and future design iterations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performed stress analysis and product testing on load-bearing components
        to verify mechanical reliability and ensure safe performance under a
        60 lbf load.

      <h3>Light-Up LED Keychain PCB</h3>
      <p><em>KiCad · PCB Design · Soldering</em></p>
      <p>
        Designed and troubleshot a custom USB-powered LED keychain PCB in KiCad,
        including schematic creation, footprint design, and board routing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created a custom USB-A connector footprint and implemented grounding
        strategies using copper pours and thermal vias.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prepared PCB design files for manufacturing, considering component
        placement, assembly, and long-term durability.
