    <h1>Space Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      My interest in space engineering focuses on building robotic systems that can operate
      reliably in extreme extraterrestrial environments where failure is not an option.

  <!-- ===== WHY SPACE ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/planet.png" alt="Why Space Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Why Space?</h2>
    <p>
      My curiosity about space began in middle school when my teacher talked about the
      Cassini mission and shared updates on its discoveries. Learning about a spacecraft
      exploring another planet made space feel vast, unknown, and exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      During high school, watching SpaceX’s Demo-2 launch during the pandemic completely
      captivated me. Seeing astronauts launch from Earth for the first time in nearly a
      decade showed how far human innovation has come—and how much farther we can still go.

  <!-- ===== MOTOR CONTROL AND PROGRAMMING ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/robot.png" alt="Motor Control Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Motor Control & Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Space robotics relies heavily on precise motor control and robust programming.
      Systems must execute accurate movements while adapting to delays, uncertainty,
      and limited communication with Earth.

  <!-- ===== HARSH ENVIRONMENTS ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/snow.png" alt="Harsh Environment Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Harsh Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Space presents extreme challenges such as radiation exposure, vacuum conditions,
      and massive temperature swings. Engineering solutions must prioritize reliability,
      redundancy, and material durability.
    </p>

  <!-- ===== SPACE SYSTEM DESIGN ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/satellite.png" alt="Satellite Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Space System Design</h2>
    <p>
      Designing space systems requires integrating mechanical, electrical, and software
      components into a unified platform while meeting strict constraints on mass,
      power consumption, and safety.

  <!-- ===== HARDWARE FOR ROBOTS ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/gear.png" alt="Hardware Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Hardware for Robots</h2>
    <p>
      Robotic space missions depend on high-reliability hardware including sensors,
      actuators, controllers, and power systems that allow autonomous operation in
      environments where human intervention is impossible.
