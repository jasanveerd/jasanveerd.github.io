  <!-- ===== WHY SPACE ===== -->
  <section id="why-space" class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/planet.png" alt="Space Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Why Space?</h2>
    <p>
      My curiosity about space began in middle school when my teacher talked about the
      Cassini mission and shared updates on its discoveries. Learning about a spacecraft
      exploring another planet made space feel vast, unknown, and exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      During high school, watching SpaceX’s Demo-2 launch during the pandemic completely
      captivated me. Seeing astronauts launch from Earth for the first time in nearly a
      decade showed me how far human innovation has come—and how much farther we can still go.

  <!-- ===== MOTOR CONTROL AND PROGRAMMING ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/robot.png" alt="Motor Control Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Motor Control and Programming</h2>
    <p>
      This section covers how we control robotic motors in space applications, including
      the programming techniques needed for precise movement, automation, and adaptive
      control systems.

  <!-- ===== HARSH ENVIRONMENT ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/snow.png" alt="Harsh Environment Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Harsh Environment</h2>
    <p>
      Space presents extreme conditions—temperature swings, radiation, and vacuum—that
      require specialized materials, designs, and safety considerations to ensure
      equipment and missions function reliably.

  <!-- ===== SPACE SYSTEM DESIGN ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/satellite.png" alt="Space System Design Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Space System Design</h2>
    <p>
      Designing a space system requires integrating mechanical, electrical, and software
      components into a cohesive and reliable spacecraft or instrument while meeting
      strict performance, weight, and safety requirements.

  <!-- ===== HARDWARE FOR ROBOTS ===== -->
  <section class="section">
    <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/66fcf1/gear.png" alt="Hardware Icon" class="icon">
    <h2>Hardware for Robots</h2>
    <p>
      Robots in space rely on advanced hardware to operate effectively, including
      sensors, actuators, controllers, and power systems that allow precise movement
      and autonomous functioning under extreme conditions.
