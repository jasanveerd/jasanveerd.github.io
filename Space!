<!-- ===== WHY SPACE ===== -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Why Space?</h2>

  <p>
    My curiosity about space began in middle school when my teacher talked about the
    Cassini mission and shared updates on its discoveries. Learning about a spacecraft
    exploring another planet made space feel vast, unknown, and exciting.

  <p>
    During high school, watching SpaceX’s Demo-2 launch during the pandemic completely
    captivated me. Seeing astronauts launch from Earth for the first time in nearly a
    decade showed me how far human innovation has come—and how much farther we can still go.
